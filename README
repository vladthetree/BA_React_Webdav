## Getting Started

To start the application, special commands are defined to independently start the Node.js server and the Progressive Web App (PWA) and wait for them to be ready. Prior to this, it is necessary to enter the command `npm install` in the terminal of the app directory to download all necessary dependencies. Afterwards, the following commands can be used to start different modes of the application:

- `npm run start:all`: Starts both the server and the PWA.
- `npm run start:server`: Starts only the server.
- `npm run start:pwa`: Starts only the PWA.
- `npm run watch:pwa`: Starts only the PWA in watch mode, which automatically applies parallel changes to the code.

In addition, the file `.env.example` must be renamed to `.env`. Here, environment variables can be adjusted, for example, to adjust intervals for retrieving videos or target addresses of the PWA to the server.
